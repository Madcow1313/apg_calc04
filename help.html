1. Use digits and dot to enter numbers (up to 255 symbols).<br>
2. Use +,-,*,/ to perform simple mathematical operations.<br>
3. +x and -x stand for unary plus and unary minus accordingly.<br>
4. Use +x and -x because they are different from + and - .<br>
For example: 49 / (unary_minus 7) will give us -7,<br>
49 / (-7) will give us undefined behaviour dew to implementation.<br>
5. Use brackets otherwise get error. <br>
6. Use sin, cos, e.t.c to perform trigonometrical operations.<br>
7. log - is logarithm with base 10, ln - with base e.<br>
8. sqrt stands for square root, ^ - for power.<br>
9. Have fun clicking buttons, because there is no keyboard interaction.:)<br><br><br><br>

<h5>This is like third iteration on go-calculator. First it was made using gotk (gtk+3 wrapper on go) and glade.<br>
Then it was refactored to match mvp pattern.<br>
Now front is made via electron. Took me like 3 days to rewrite application.
(first day - html and css stuff, second day - electron connecting, third day - adding some additional code).
So you really facing calculator-3.0 =^._.^= </h5>
